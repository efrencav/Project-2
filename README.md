# Project-2

The project will consist of an online store to sell cowboy boots for a general audience. A quick walk through of the client interface as they access the site will be: User lands on the website, they shop through the available options, they select a product and add it to the shopping cart.

Once the customer is ready to check-out, the customer will be able to create a user profile, or login with existing credentails.
They will be able to pay for the items purchased and will receive an email with the order details. Also, the customer will be able to see a pdf invoice version of the sale when they access the site admin section.

For Administrator use: the admin can access the back end of the site and add/remove/edit a product and check inventory.
